# Purpose
To test how NASM treats size casting when calling and loading memory locations

# Summary
While I learned what I was intending to with memory size, I'm having trouble getting printf to work correctly and I'm not entirely sure why. There's a lot of reasons it could be breaking, but I'm starting to think just writing in C will be a better idea. I'm a lot more familiar with the language, portability will be significantly easier, and code will be much easier to read and document. 

I should also set up doxygen for the source code.
